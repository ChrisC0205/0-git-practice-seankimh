# Git Workflow Assignment – Reflection on an Article

## Interesting Article: *The Rise of Worse Is Better*

I decided to read and reflect on the article *“The Rise of Worse Is Better”* by Richard P. Gabriel, which can be found at:  
https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html

This article talks about a software design philosophy called **“worse is better”**, which states that sometimes simpler designs with less functionality can be more successful in the real world than more complex and “perfect” designs.

The author talks about two philosophies of software design:

- **The “MIT/Stanford” approach (“the right thing”)** — aims for complete, correct, and consistent designs, even if they are complex.
- **The “New Jersey” approach (“worse is better”)** — favors ease of implementation over interface complexity and completeness.

The author illustrates these philosophies using early Unix and the C programming language. Unix and C may not have been the most complete or elegant designs, but they were simple enough to be easily adopted and adapted, and thus spread quickly.

## Why I Found This Interesting

I found this article interesting because it presents a counterintuitive view that more complete and technically “better” solutions are not always better. Instead, it proposes that practical success and adaptability are more important than achieving perfection. As a software developer, I see this view reflected in many software tools and languages that became successful not because they were the most advanced, but because they were simple, good enough, and easy to use.

This view also made me think about how software development decisions are made in real-world teams, where sometimes developing fast and simple solutions can be more successful than developing solutions that are perfect but take too long.

### Comment from Christopher Cajamarca
I find this article interesting as it offers the perspective that simplicity is often the best way to do something rather than something complex. When reading it, I think of basketball and how sometimes the fundamentals is all it takes to score rather than a step back fade away shot. While one looks better than the other, at the end of the day both get the task that is wanted to get done, done.
